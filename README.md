### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Victor Orlunda, fulltime student and a budding software developer based in Port Harcourt, Nigeria ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬

ðŸ”­ My current tech stack include:
 
 - HTML, CSS and JavaScript(ES6+)
 - Node.js
 - ExpressJS
 - MongoDB
 - Mongoose
 - Jest/Tape/SuperTest

I'm currently on the lookout for entry level backend-focused developer jobs and/or (paid) internships to propel myself out of the infamous *tutorial purgatory* and improve my skills while learning other worthwhile stuff.

I'm a very hardworking person with a knack for paying attention to details. I'm also pretty fast at learning and picking up new stuff within a relatively short amount of time.

Feel free to browse my pinned repositories as well as my other repositories for some little side projects I've worked on ðŸ˜ƒ
